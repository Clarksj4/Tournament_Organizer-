h1. Developing the Website

h2. Docker
You will need docker to run the webserver as it is in a docker container. Note
that the initial install and setup of the docker image will require a lot of
shit to get downloaded. Be prepared to wait and don't try this at uni behind
some bullshit proxy.

* Install docker. You can do this in Windows - good luck to you sir!
* Build the webserver image thusly:
** cd <to_dir>/webserver
** sudo docker build -t webserver .  # NB '.' specifies that the Dockerfile
(used to build the image) is in this dir. 'webserver' is just the name of the
resulting image; you can call it whatever you want; webserver seems sane.
* Run the image to start the webserver:
** sudo docker run -t -i webserver <webserver start command TBD>
