h1. Developing the Website

h2. Docker
You will need docker to run the webserver as it is in a docker container. Note
that the initial install and setup of the docker image will require a lot of
shit to get downloaded. Be prepared to wait and don't try this at uni behind
some bullshit proxy.

* Install docker. You can do this in Windows - good luck to you sir!
* Build the webserver image thusly:
** cd <to_dir>/webserver
** sudo docker build -t webserver .  # NB '.' specifies that the Dockerfile
(used to build the image) is in this dir. 'webserver' is just the name of the
resulting image; you can call it whatever you want; webserver seems sane.
* Run the image to start the webserver:
** sudo docker run --name=webserver -d -p 5000:5000 webserver

h2. Adding new files

If you want to add new files to the webserver you simply need to rebuild the
container. Note that only the src directory gets mounted into the container.
You can add other directories by altering the Dockerfile (c.f. the ADD commands
at the bottom.
